# MakArio Platform Map (Public)

MakArio is a modular system. Modules are sovereign and communicate only via events.

## Runtime roles (public)
- **Manager** — governance: consent, policies, export/share, legal/tax templates, device hub boundaries
- **Medical** — safety context: prevention, constraints, education (no diagnosis)
- **AI Judge** — evidence pipeline: clips, metadata, identifiers, reliable delivery
- **AI Trainer** — private reference module: live mentoring style and interaction rules (implementation not published)
- Future: SmartFood, Fitness, LinguaAI, Social…

## Module readiness (public capsule)
We communicate readiness through a simple capsule scale:
`[ Concept ░░░░░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓▓▓░░░ Production ██████░ ]`

Readiness legend: `docs/READINESS.md`

## Public vs Private boundary
Public: concepts, roles, boundaries, contracts, governance.
Private: implementation, algorithms, proprietary control points logic, internal voice/camera details.
