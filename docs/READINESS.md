# Module Readiness (Public)

MakArio modules grow independently. This page shows **readiness** in a simple “capsule” format.

## Capsule scale (legend)

`[ Concept ░░░░░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓▓▓░░░ Production ██████░ ]`

- **Concept** — architecture + public contract; not yet validated in pilots
- **Pilot** — can be piloted with partners; traces + governance boundaries exist
- **Production** — repeatable deployments; operational hardening + compliance packaging

> Public-only: readiness reflects **process maturity**, not private implementation details.

## Criteria (public, short)

**Concept**
- public role and boundaries documented
- input/output events described
- governance assumptions stated

**Pilot**
- evidence / traces are defined (audit-ready)
- export/share governance described (Manager-gated)
- partner deployment path described

**Production**
- repeatable deployment playbooks
- monitoring / failure modes documented
- compliance packaging and operational policies defined

## Current module readiness (public)

| Module | Capsule | Public status | Notes (public) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AI Judge** | `[ Concept ░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ Production █░░░░░ ]` | **Pilot (in validation)** | Evidence packs: clips (~3s) + metadata + delivery trace. Human judges remain final. |
| **Manager** | `[ Concept ░░░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓░░░░░ Production ░░░░░░ ]` | **Concept → Pilot** | Governance OS: consent, policies, export/share control, legal/tax templates (templates/workflows only). |
| **Medical** | `[ Concept ░░░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓░░░░░ Production ░░░░░░ ]` | **Concept → Pilot** | Safety context: constraints, prevention, education. No diagnosis. User-aligned communication style, topic-only. |
| **AI Trainer** | `[ Concept ░░░░░░ Pilot ▓▓▓▓░░░░ Production ░░░░░░ ]` | **Private reference module** | Acts as a behavior reference (“live” communication). Private libraries/details are not published in this vitrine. |
| Future modules | `[ Concept ░░░░░░░░░░ Pilot ░░░░░░░░░ Production ░░░░░░ ]` | **Planned** | SmartFood, Fitness, LinguaAI, Social… documented when public contracts exist. |
