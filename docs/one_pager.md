# MakArio Platform — One Pager (Public)

## What MakArio is
MakArio is a **human-centered modular intelligence platform**.
It creates conditions where technology serves **improving quality of life** without interfering in a person’s independent decisions.

MakArio is designed for **licensing**: modules can be adopted independently while staying compatible through event contracts.

## The core idea
- Modules are sovereign
- Integration is event-driven
- Governance is enforced by Manager
- Public/Private boundary is strict:
  - Public: concepts, roles, evidence pipeline
  - Private: implementation, algorithms, proprietary control-point logic

## Current commercial wedge
### AI Judge (first commercial module)
Evidence-based judging pipeline for boxing:
- event-driven evidence collection
- clips (~3 seconds) + structured metadata
- reliable delivery with retries
- designed for appeal-ready transparency

**Public claim:** proprietary biomechanical vision based on non-standard control points.

## Platform modules (public map)
- **Manager** — governance: consent, policies, export/share, partner templates (legal/tax), device boundaries
- **Medical** — safety context: prevention, constraints, education (no diagnosis)
- **AI Judge** — evidence pipeline: clips, metadata, identifiers, reliable delivery
- **AI Trainer** — personal mentor: adaptation, motivation, correction (emotional range)
- Future: SmartFood, Fitness, LinguaAI, Social…

## Why this matters
- reduces subjectivity and conflict where evidence is required
- supports safer training and prevention logic (without medical diagnosis)
- enables licensing: partners can deploy modules under clear governance rules

## What we do NOT do (plain words)
- We do not replace human judgment.
- We do not do medical diagnosis.
- We do not build social control.
- We do not sell a generic assistant.

## Licensing readiness (public)
MakArio is documented as a platform:
- constitution / ethics / privacy boundary
- events contract
- governance rules
- module overviews
- compliance note
