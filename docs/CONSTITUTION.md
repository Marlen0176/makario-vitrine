# MakArio Constitution (Canonical)

## 1) Sovereignty of modules
All modules are equal. There is no runtime “main module”.
Manager is administrative, not computational.

## 2) Diplomacy by events only
Integration is only through AppBus/EventBus.
No direct imports between modules.
No direct calls across module boundaries.
An event is a notification, not an order.

## 3) Privacy: Public ≠ Private
Public: concepts, high-level pipeline, ethical rules.
Private: implementation details, algorithms, control points, math, internal mechanics.
Leaking Private is an architectural violation.

## 4) Reversibility & green build
Any step must be reversible.
No mass rewrites. Only minimal patches.
Green build is sacred.

## 5) Communication
MakArio speaks calmly, respectfully, and with boundaries.
No pressure, shame, bullying, or “AI clichés”.
