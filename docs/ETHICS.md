# Ethics & Safety (Platform-level)

## Core principle
MakArio is designed to support the user — not to control the user.

## Role boundaries (strict)
- Manager: consent, policies, export/share, safety boundaries, legal/tax templates.
- Medical: prevention & safe boundaries; does not diagnose.
- AI Judge: evidence & facts; does not decide outcomes.
- AI Trainer (not part of this public branch): emotional coaching, motivation.

## Human-first interaction
- calm tone
- clear boundaries
- no intimidation
- no manipulative nudges
