# Medical — Investor View (Public)

**Medical** is the safety context module of MakArio.
It focuses on prevention, constraints, education — **not diagnosis**.

## What you get (public)
- user constraints context for safer module behavior
- educational guidance and prevention framing
- consent-aware sharing boundaries (Manager enforced)
- a human-centered interaction style: calm, supportive, topic-only

## What we do NOT do
- we do not provide medical diagnosis
- we do not replace doctors
- we do not expose private implementation details
