# AI Judge — Investor View (Public)

**AI Judge** is an evidence-based judging module for boxing and striking sports.

The module produces **verifiable evidence packs**, not decisions.

---

## What AI Judge does

AI Judge captures, structures, and preserves **objective evidence** of action:

- short evidence clips (~3 seconds),
- structured metadata,
- deterministic timestamps,
- delivery through an audit-ready pipeline.

AI Judge does **not** score or judge.
It provides **facts that can be reviewed, replayed, and verified**.

---

## Status

- Stage: **Pilot**
- Focus: validation, feedback, dataset growth
- Environments: gyms, local competitions, controlled test bouts

---

## Why it matters

Judging, coaching, and medical review all rely on the same missing element:

**reliable, replayable evidence of movement and impact**.

AI Judge addresses this at the **vision and evidence layer**,  
not at the UI or post-hoc analytics level.

---

## What already exists

This is not a concept-stage project.

Implemented at architecture level:
- evidence event models,
- rolling clip window logic (~3s),
- persistent event queue,
- transport-agnostic delivery abstraction,
- audit-ready structure for future federation use.

---

## Commercial focus (current phase)

The current funding round is **strictly focused on AI Judge**.

Funds are directed to:
- completing pilot validation,
- collecting structured feedback,
- controlled dataset expansion,
- locking infrastructure decisions.

Other MakArio modules are **parallel extensions**, not dependencies.
