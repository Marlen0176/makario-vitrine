# AI Judge — Investor View (Public)

## What it is
**AI Judge** is an evidence-based judging pipeline for boxing.
It produces **appeal-ready evidence packs**: short clips + structured metadata + traceable delivery.

## The wedge (why now)
- disputes and subjectivity are expensive
- commissions and broadcasters need audit-ready evidence
- clubs need training feedback with clear boundaries

## What you get (public)
- evidence capture (≈3s clip windows)
- event metadata (timestamp, bout id, round, actor ids)
- reliable delivery (queue + retry)
- audit trace: what was captured, when, and under which consent/policy

## What we do NOT do
- we do not replace human judges
- we do not publish private implementation details
- we do not claim medical diagnosis

## Monetization (public)
Licensing per venue / per commission / per broadcast deployment.
AI Judge can be adopted standalone and later extended by other MakArio modules.
