# AI Judge — Regulator View (Public)

## Safety boundary
AI Judge is an evidence pipeline, not a final decision maker.
It supports transparency and dispute handling.

## Governance
- consent-aware operations (Manager enforced)
- policy-based redaction
- export/share is controlled and traceable
- audit traces are preserved

## Privacy boundary
- Public: roles, contracts, governance
- Private: implementation, algorithms, proprietary control-point logic
