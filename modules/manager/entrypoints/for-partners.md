# Manager — Partner View (Public)

## Why partners need Manager
- governance and modes (training / competition / demo / privacy)
- export/share rules (who can export, what is redacted)
- device hub boundaries (what devices are allowed, under what consent)
- audit traces for disputes and compliance

## Integration model (public)
- modules communicate via **events**
- Manager is the gate for export/share and policy envelopes
