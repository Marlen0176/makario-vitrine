# Manager — Investor View (Public)

**Manager** is the governance OS of MakArio.
It makes module deployments licensable and compliant by enforcing policies and consent.

## What you get (public)
- consent-aware operations across modules
- export/share control (policy + redaction)
- audit-ready traces (what/when/under which policy)
- partner-ready templates (legal/tax workflows) — structured, jurisdiction-adaptable

## What we do NOT do
- we do not replace lawyers or tax professionals
- we do not “diagnose” or “judge” for people
- we do not expose private implementation details
