# Manager — Governance OS

Manager is the legal and governance layer of MakArio.
It does not replace lawyers or tax professionals.
It provides **templates, workflows, and enforcement logic** that allow partners to deploy MakArio modules compliantly.

Key guarantees (public):
- consent-aware operations
- export and sharing control
- policy-based redaction
- audit-ready event traces

# Manager — Administrative Core (Public overview)

Manager is the administrative core of MakArio:
- policies and consent
- safety boundaries and modes
- export/share governance
- device hub governance
- legal/tax templates (structured, jurisdiction-adaptable)

Manager does not:
- train
- treat
- interpret biomechanics
Manager speaks rarely and only for boundaries: cold, structured, legally clean.
